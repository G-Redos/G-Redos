# Team Charter
We are team Priceless

Bearing in mind the EQ learning we‚Äôve done with Dana and elsewhere, we want to foster a good team to work in

**We plan to meet:**
- At 10am for morning standup (15min)

- At 5pm for a retro at the end of the day

**We value:**

    - Helper
        - Looks out for members who have taken on too much as well as members who don‚Äôt have enough to do
        - Looks out for the health of other members, ensures they‚Äôre taking breaks

<br>

5. **Work Flows**
    - Pairing
        - Pull latest version of main
        - Check-out a new branch / existing branch for your ticket
        - Work in branch, and keep committing upstream
        - Merge latest main again before pull request to avoid merge conflicts
        - Submit pull-request
        - Move card on Trello
        - Add PR link to card 
        - Alert team on Slack

    - Trello protocol
        - If a pair is working on it, it has your name on it
        - If it needs review, it has the reviewers name
        - If it has been reviewed and needs updating, it is in the Updating column
        - If you are the second reviewer and all is ok, accept & merge

    - During pairings, resolve challenges by:
        - Debugging and stuck on a 1 hour+ blocker? ask for help!
        - Need to chat about something? Write on Slack
        - Need to know the answer now? Directly join a pair with whom you‚Äôd like to discuss an urgent issue.
        - Cannot move on unless big issue is resolved as a team? Ask scrum master for help
<br>

 6. **Stand-Up**
    - Voice roles for the day
    - Do any tasks need breaking down?
    - Prioritise
    - Estimate
    - Sprint backlog
    - Assign rand() pairs
<br>

7. **Retro**
    - What did we think would happen, what actually happened?
    - What went well, what could we do better tomorrow? 
<br>
